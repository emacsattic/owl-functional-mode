This is a simple Emacs major mode for writing OWL ontologies in the OWL functional syntax. It currently only supports syntax highlighting.

The syntax highlighting is based on the [OWL2 quick reference](http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-quick-reference/). The OWL terms from sections 3 and 5 have not yet been added.
